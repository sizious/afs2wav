# AFS2WAV [ADXUtil GUI] 

**AFS2WAV** is a graphical user-interface (_GUI_) for the **ADXUtil** program made by
**Verdi Kasugano**. It was first released on **Sep. 24, 2004**.

## Introduction

**ADXUtil** is a tiny tool made to convert **CRI Middleware ADX Audio Files** (_ADX_) to the **Waveform Audio File Format** (_WAV_).

_ADX_ file format was widely used in the early 2000, mainly for the **Sega Dreamcast** console but also for the **Sony Playstation 2** and from time to time the **Nintendo GameCube**.

_ADX_ files are most of the time embedded in _AFS_ archives, which can be dealt with [AFS Utils](https://github.com/shentrad/afs-utils/). _AFS_ files are considered like archives but without compression.

## Usage

1. Run **AFS2WAV**.
2. Select an _AFS_ archive through the contextual menu (mouse right-click).
3. Click the _Convert_ button when ready.

## Credits

Thanks to **Verdi Kasugano** for the original **ADXUtil** tool.
